play -- 

🎶 I don't care who you are 
Where you're from
What you did... 🎸

🎶 Tell me why
Ain't nothin' but a heartache
Tell me why
Ain't nothin' but a mistake 🎶


🎶 Cuz you're still here 
Your feet stuck to the ground
Despite how silly it sounds
You're bigger
Than me
Lalala 🎶


--- Dedicated to `The man with a golden heart.`
